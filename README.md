# React + TypeScript

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:


## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:



```js
 <RichTextEditor
                    initialContent={content}
                    onChange={(htmlContent) => {
                        setContent(htmlContent);
                    }}
                />

 
```
